# This is a React Progressive Web App!

We are using progressive web apps to learn about how they work and to also build some cool tools for the xandr hackathon. The goal of this PWA is to show a proof of concept that we can make the onboarding process for new customers easier and more streamlined. Some initial goals in mind

## Goals
- Make initialization easier: Location, currency, timezone, etc
- Streamline what kind of inventory they are looking to buy or sell
- Set them up in our system with the most modern technology that we have (ALIs, Guaranteed Deals, newest ad quality features, etc.)
- Have this initial UI setup lead to a fully streamlined backend for data center connections, DB connections, and overall quality upgrades for international customers
